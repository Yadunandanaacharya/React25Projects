*. project start coding
* use below command to avoid git error while creating react app
npx create-react-app my-app --no-git

once run above command run this command to go inside that folder my-app
cd my-app

with this it goes my-app directory

next you've to run 
npm start

I made mistake: in directory behind my-app i run "npm start" it gave error
PS D:\ABBCodesDon't add other repos here\MyGitDontAddAnyFile\React25Projects> npm start                  
npm ERR! code ENOENT
